Oh man, just walked out and my butt's still complaining about those seats. The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep was a total bewildering ride. Little popcorn kernels still stuck to my teeth, tiny rebels, honestly. Anyway, a quick note to—I forget who wanted me to download the movie later? Anyhoo, kind of lost myself there. The theater was noisy, like a whizzing dental drill that wouldn't stop.

Geralt, he’s got this perpetual scowl, reminds me of when I tell a patient they've really got to floss more with that hardened look. There’s this scene with him fending off sirens—flashing back to when that kid was screaming in the clinic, both sort of chaotic sounds yet strangely melodious. Water spirals and sinewy creatures everywhere, kinda felt like when you rinse after fluoride, that swirling sensation.

> That plot twist—felt like discovering a whole new wisdom tooth suddenly lurking in the dark abyss of someone’s gums. Who would've thought that lady merman was actually a double-crossing sorceress? Like juggling files in a messy dental office, things just flipped all over the place. 

Everyone in the theater was like sardines. Back ached from being squeezed in, yet I was glued to the screen. The ocean, wild like the sound of a rotary tool, smashing waves matching my heartbeat somehow. Oh, right, did someone ask if they could watch the movie next Tuesday? My memory’s like a sieve today.

Got lost in the visuals, glistening sea creatures shimmering like that weird mouthwash reflection under dental lights, only here it was stunning under moonlight. Explosions in the deep, and my brain’s pasting images over images—coffee spilled over paper patient charts. Yennefer? Magic like those numbing shots that take pain and sense away together.

Tangled in thoughts too, brooding like Geralt. Why is magic kinda like dental X-rays? Invisible forces working, revealing hidden stuff. That last bit though (did I mention the plot twist already?), my heart dropped like when you accidentally ask for an extraction instead of a filling.

No more babbling, my head's spinning like the tools I need to sterilize back at work. Okay, brain stuck on this nonsense now.

```
int main() {
    char witcher[] = SirensDep;
    while(witcher != NULL) {
        return 1/0;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
